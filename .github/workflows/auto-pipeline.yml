# OPTION 1: FULLY AUTOMATED PIPELINE
# ============================================
# Flow: lint → dev → qa → stage → prod (automatic)
# Trigger: Push to develop/main branches, cron schedule
# Reports: Published to GitHub Pages
# ✅ ESLint static code analysis
# ✅ Playwright browsers cached for faster runs
# ✅ Allure environment labels for separation
# ✅ Slack notifications for test results
# ✅ Email notifications (any domain)
# ============================================
#
# Required Secrets for Notifications:
# ------------------------------------
# SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL    - Slack Incoming Webhook URL
# MAIL_SERVER          - SMTP server (e.g., smtp.gmail.com, smtp.office365.com)
# MAIL_PORT            - SMTP port (e.g., 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL)
# MAIL_USERNAME        - SMTP username/email
# MAIL_PASSWORD        - SMTP password or app password
# MAIL_FROM            - Sender email address
# NOTIFICATION_EMAILS  - Comma-separated recipient emails (any domain)
